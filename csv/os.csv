Subtitle,Spec Advertising Campaign
Problem,"The National Student Advertising Competition's 2018 client was Ocean Spray, who hoped to increase household penetration in 25-34 year old millenials. As a member of Johnson & Wales University's Ad Team, I worked as an art director and part-time copywriter to create a fully-integrated national campaign."
Solution,"Focusing in on the idea that we all make a concisous choice throughout our day to keep doing the same old thing, we introduced the tagline ""Add Different to your Day"". By creating our own dayparts, we were able to serve ads to our target on the media that they were most likely to be using, rationing a sparse budget while spreading our footprint onto many different outlets."
Results,"Our campaign placed first in District One (New England), and just narrowly missed attending the Finals by coming in 9th in the Semifinal round.
